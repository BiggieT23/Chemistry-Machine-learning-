# Chemistry-Machine-learning
Machine learning project using a chemistry-based wine dataset to classify wine quality based on physicochemical properties


In this project, supervised machine learning models were developed to classify wine quality using a chemistry dataset containing physicochemical measurements. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, normalization, model training, and performance evaluation.

Classification algorithms were implemented and compared to assess how chemical variables contribute to predictive accuracy.
